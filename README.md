Walmart-Retail-Sales-Linear-Regression-Prediction
=================================================

A bagging algorithm to predict retail sales at a number of WalMart stores based on economic condition indicators. This project was completed as a part of a Kaggle competition in which WalMart made data available on select WalMart stores. The data contains the weekly sales figure for each store observed over a period of time. The data also contain economic condition variables which are used to predict the magnitude of retail sales at the store.
